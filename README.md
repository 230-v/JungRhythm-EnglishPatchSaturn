<h1>Jung Rhythm</h1>
<img width="165" height="165" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/JungRhythm-EnglishPatchSaturn/blob/main/images/cover.png?raw=true">English translation patch for the rhythm game "Jung Rhythm" on the Sega Saturn.
<br><br>
"Jung Rhythm" is a rhythm game for the Sega Saturn, often compared to "PaRappa the Rapper" for some of its similarities, although according to records, both games were in development simultaneously.
<br><br>
The player takes the role of Vanilla Essence, a young girl who dreams of being a star. The story follows her quest from eating breakfast through to a duet with her favorite superstar, the earth-loving rocker, Mr. Chorking!
<br><br>
The gameplay itself takes the form of call-and-response dance and song duets with various characters, where the other characters will sing a line and the player is asked to repeat it. Lyrics appear at the top of the screen, while input prompts appear in the first of a pair of bars along the bottom of the screen as they sing. Ad-libbed inputs are also permitted, and there are specific ad-lib segments.
<br><br>
Vanilla Essence's performance is then graded in five categories and given an overall score. A score above 70 is a passing grade, and allows continuing to the next story segment. Between story segments there is a short full-motion video cutscene connecting the dots.
<br><br>
The game additionally includes a practice mode, as well as a two-player "BATTLE" mode, where players can compare their skills.
<br><br>
The latest version of this patch is <a href="xxxxx">1.0</a>.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/JungRhythm-EnglishPatchSaturn/blob/main/images/screenshot_1.png?raw=true" width="290" height="210">"Jung Rhythm" features six playable stages (as well as a bonus end stage), as well as a two-player "BATTLE" mode, and a training mode. Each stage requires players to mimic the instructor, following along with button presses in time with the music.
<br><br>
In two-player "BATTLE" mode, there are two gameplay styles to choose from: "RHYTHM JUNGLE" and "BATTLE JUNGLE". The former features a back-and-forth where each player takes turns, whereas the latter features a separate bar on the bottom of the screen for both players to sing and dance at the same time.
<br><br>
Throughout each single-player stage, a message appears one or more times informing players that it's time to freestyle ("Ad-libbing"). While any combination of buttons will suffice, below are a list of finishing moves for each playable character, awarding extra points.

<h2>Good and Bad Endings</h2>
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/JungRhythm-EnglishPatchSaturn/blob/main/images/screenshot_2.png?raw=true" width="290" height="203">If players receive a score of 465 or better on stage six, where Vanilla dances with Mr. Chorking on stage, they will be rewarded with an additional bonus stage after fans demand an encore from Mr. Chorking.
<br><br>
Additionally, an alternative final video sequence will play, dubbed as the "good ending". This version of the ending is also the only way to see the staff credits video.
<br><br>
If players are unable to achieve a sufficient score to see this ending during their first playthrough of the game, they can use the "LOAD" option on the main menu to replay stage six and try again.
