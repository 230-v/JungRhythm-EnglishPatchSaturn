<h1>Jung Rhythm</h1>
<img width="165" height="165" align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/JungRhythm-EnglishPatchSaturn/blob/main/images/cover.png?raw=true">English translation patch for the rhythm game "Jung Rhythm" on the Sega Saturn.
<br><br>
"Jung Rhythm" is a rhythm game for the Sega Saturn, often compared to PaRappa the Rapper for some of its similarities.
<br><br>
The player takes the role of Vanilla Essence, a young girl who dreams of being a star, and the story follows her quest from eating breakfast through to a duet with her favourite superstar, the puzzlingly named Mr. Chorking!
<br><br>
The gameplay itself takes the form of call-and-response dance and song duets with various characters, where the other character will sing a line and you're asked to repeat it. Lyrics appear in a shaded box at the top of the screen, while input prompts appear in the first of a pair of bars along the bottom of the screen as they sing, and the player then repeats it on the second bar. Ad-libbed inputs are also permitted, and there are specific ad-lib segments.
<br><br>
Vanilla Essence's performance is then graded in five categories and given an overall score. A score above 70 is a passing grade, and allows continuing to the next story segment. Between story segments there is a short full-motion video cutscene connecting the dots.
<br><br>
The game additionally includes a practice mode, as well as a two-player battle mode, where two players can compare their skills.
<br><br>
The latest version of this patch is <a href="xxxxx">1.0</a>.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/JungRhythm-EnglishPatchSaturn/blob/main/images/screenshot_1.png?raw=true" width="290" height="210">"Jung Rhythm" features six playable stages (as well as a bonus end stage), as well as a two-player battle mode, and a training mode. Each stage requires players to mimic the instruction, following along with the button presses in time with the music.
<br><br>
Throughout each stage, a message appears on or more times informing players that it's time to freestyle ("Ad-libbing"). While any combination of buttons will suffice, below are a list of finishing moves for each playable character.
